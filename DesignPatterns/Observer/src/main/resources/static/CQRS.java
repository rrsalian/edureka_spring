/*
 * CQRS Design Pattern (Microservice Pattern)
 * CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. 
 * It is a design pattern that separates the responsibilities of reading and 
 * writing data. In a CQRS system, there are two separate models for reading 
 * and writing data, each with its own interface.
 * The command model is responsible for writing data, and it exposes a simple
 * interface that allows clients to submit commands to change the system state.
 * The query model is responsible for reading data, and it exposes a more 
 * complex interface that allows clients to retrieve data from the system.
 * 
 * The main benefits of using the CQRS design pattern are:
 * Improved scalability: By separating the responsibilities of reading and 
 * writing data, the CQRS design pattern allows you to scale the read and 
 * write components of your system independently. This can be particularly 
 * useful if your system experiences a lot of read or write traffic. 
 * Improved performance: Because the command model has a simple interface 
 * and does not need to perform any complex queries, it can process requests 
 * faster than a traditional system that uses a single model for both reading 
 * and writing. Simplified development: By separating the responsibilities of 
 * reading and writing data, the CQRS design pattern can simplify the 
 * development process, as developers can focus on a specific set of 
 * responsibilities (either reading or writing) rather than having to 
 * understand the entire system.
 * 
 * To implement the CQRS design pattern, you will need to: 
 * Define the command model, which is responsible for writing data and exposes 
 * a simple interface for submitting commands. Define the query model, which 
 * is responsible for reading data and exposes a more complex interface for 
 * retrieving data. Ensure that the command model and query model are kept in 
 * sync so that the state of the system is consistent. 
 * 
 * Here is an example of the CQRS design pattern in Java:
 * // Command model interface
 * 
public interface CommandModel {
    void submitCommand(Command command);
}

// Concrete command model
public class BankAccountCommandModel implements CommandModel {
    @Override
    public void submitCommand(Command command) {
        if (command instanceof DepositCommand) {
            // Deposit money into the bank account
        } else if (command instanceof WithdrawCommand) {
            // Withdraw money from the bank account
        }
    }
}

// Query model interface
public interface QueryModel {
    BankAccount getAccount(String accountId);
}

// Concrete query model
public class BankAccountQueryModel implements QueryModel {
    private Map<String, BankAccount> accounts;

    public BankAccountQueryModel() {
        accounts = new HashMap<>();
    }

    @Override
    public BankAccount getAccount(String accountId) {
        return accounts.get(accountId);
    }
}
*
